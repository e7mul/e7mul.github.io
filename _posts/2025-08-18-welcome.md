This is a first post. You can write in Markdown, including code blocks and math.

Inline math like \(E=mc^2\), and display math:

\[ \int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} \, dx = \tfrac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2} \]

Code example:

```python
def hello(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(hello("world"))
```
